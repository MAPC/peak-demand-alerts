  Each column shows the day, the forecasted high temperature, estimated peak
  load, and the risk level of reaching the annual peak.

UNLIKELY < #{ min_gw } GW
POSSIBLE #{ min_gw } GW - #{ max_gw } GW

  How to use this table
  -----------------------------------------

  The following table is intended as a guide to help entities anticipate when
  the annual peak load for the ISO-NE system2 will occur and to make their own
  decisions about whether and when to load shed.

  The "Risk of the Annual Peak" rating is generated by MAPC based on a
  comparison of the estimated Peak Load for the day reported by ISO-NE and load
  on historic annual peak days.

  It is a recommendation only.

  This service, provided by MAPC, is intended for municipal and commercial
  facility operators that will use it to manage their building energy use.
